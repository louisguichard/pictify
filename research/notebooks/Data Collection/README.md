# Data Collection

Two methods are used to collect data: **Google Image web scraping** and **Open Images dataset queries**.

The first method allows us to make precise searches, but results are sometimes irrelevant. The second method provides better quality data (fewer false positives), but the number of available labels limits our search possibilities.
